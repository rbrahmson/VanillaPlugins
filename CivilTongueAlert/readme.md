This is a simple add-on plugin to the CivilTongueEx plugin.  It alerts the discussion/comment creator to avoid the banned words defined via the CivilTongueEx plugin.
This is suited for communities that do not have members that would try to circumvent the banned words.  Common use case: misspellings tha​​t ina​a​dvertently create a banned word.
