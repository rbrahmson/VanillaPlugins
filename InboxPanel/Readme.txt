This plugin adds the conversation (PM, or Private Messages) to the side panel.
The idea is to place the PM box more in the user's face.
Tested in VF Ver 2.1.13 using the VBS3 theme.

The administrator can customize the plugin behavior:
- The number of database entries to inspect when looking for new messages
- The maximum number of messages to show in the side panel
- Optional requirement for a role permission to see the inbox side panel
- Option to only display new messages
- Option to display alert bubble for new messages
- Option to auto-refresh the panel on set intervals
- Option to hide the side panel if there are no new messages
- Option to place the side panel on top of other side panels
  Recommended plugin to change the order of modules in the panel: Module Sort by Bleistivt
